# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community
* Helping newcomers understand the Arweave ecosystem and AOS development
* Sharing knowledge about blockchain technology and decentralized systems
* Contributing to security discussions with responsibility and transparency
* Respecting the experimental nature of blockchain technology

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Sharing or promoting malicious code or security vulnerabilities
* Attempting to exploit or attack project infrastructure
* Spreading misinformation about blockchain technology or project capabilities
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official project e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Contributing to project repositories
* Participating in community discussions and forums
* Representing the project at conferences or meetups
* Engaging in discussions about Arweave, AOS, or related technologies

## Security and Safety

Given the nature of blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, we have additional
considerations:

### Security Responsibility
* Report security vulnerabilities privately to project maintainers
* Do not publicly disclose security issues before coordinated disclosure
* Respect responsible disclosure timelines
* Do not attempt to exploit discovered vulnerabilities

### Financial Safety
* Do not provide financial advice or investment recommendations
* Clearly label experimental or testing code
* Warn users about risks associated with blockchain interactions
* Do not encourage risky financial behaviors

### Technical Safety
* Test code thoroughly before submission
* Document security implications of changes
* Follow secure coding practices
* Respect sandbox and isolation boundaries

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Primary Contact**: [Contact information to be added]
**Security Issues**: [Security contact to be added]

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Special Considerations for Blockchain Projects

### Open Source Collaboration
* Respect different levels of blockchain and cryptocurrency knowledge
* Help educate newcomers about decentralized systems
* Acknowledge the learning curve associated with blockchain development
* Share resources and knowledge openly

### Technical Discussions
* Focus on technical merits rather than personal preferences
* Provide constructive feedback on code and implementations
* Respect different approaches to solving blockchain challenges
* Acknowledge trade-offs in technical decisions

### Community Building
* Welcome developers from different blockchain ecosystems
* Foster cross-chain collaboration and learning
* Respect different viewpoints on decentralization and governance
* Build bridges with other open source communities

## Resources and Support

### Learning Resources
* [AO Cookbook](https://cookbook_ao.ar.io) - Official AOS documentation
* [Arweave Documentation](https://docs.arweave.org) - Core Arweave concepts
* [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) - How to contribute to this project

### Community Channels
* GitHub Discussions - For project-specific questions
* Arweave Discord - For broader ecosystem discussions
* Project Issues - For bug reports and feature requests

### Getting Help
If you're experiencing issues with the code of conduct or community interactions:

1. **Direct Resolution**: Try addressing minor issues directly with involved parties
2. **Community Leaders**: Contact project maintainers for guidance
3. **Escalation**: Report serious violations through official channels
4. **External Support**: Seek help from broader open source community resources
